Well, this is a project to take the distances between bases output from freelancer companion and load that into an interactive flask app which lets you set up a set of trade routes and then print that to a marketcommodities file, and then save those settings in a config file so that changes to the routes can be re-loaded and push out a new, rebalanced marketcommodities.ini file on the fly. 

Currently in fairly early stages.
